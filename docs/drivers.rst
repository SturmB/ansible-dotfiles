Hardware Drivers
################

Before installing the plethora of software on this new Windows system, let's make sure all of the hardware drivers and other related files are installed and up to date.

**************
Razer Hardware
**************

This is for the keyboard, mouse, and mousepad and is straightforward enough. Just download the `Synapse 3 driver + configuration tool <https://www.razer.com/synapse-3>`__ and install it like normal. Sign in to Razer (:title-reference:`1Password` will help here) to possibly sync settings that were saved in their cloud.

***************
Logitech Webcam
***************

This one is not quite as straightforward, as Logitech makes three different software packages available and doesn't really do a good job differentiating between them. To the best of my knowledge, we only need the :title-reference:`G Hub` software, but it cannot hurt to also install :title-reference:`Logitech Capture` and :title-reference:`Camera Settings` as well.

All three software packages (and others) can be found on `the same page <https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024699934--Downloads-C922-Pro-Stream-Webcam>`__.
