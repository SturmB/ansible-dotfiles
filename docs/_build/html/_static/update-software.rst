Update Software
===============

After getting Windows fully installed—whether through a store-bought copy, an included copy with a brand new hard drive, or by restoring a prefab computer back to factory defaults—it needs to be updated.

Update Windows
--------------

1. Go to :menuselection:`Start Menu --> Settings` or press :kbd:`Win` + :kbd:`I` to bring up :guilabel:`Windows Settings`.
2. Choose :guilabel:`Update & Security`, which should be the last item on the list.
3. From there, under the first subsection, :guilabel:`Windows Update`, press the :guilabel:`Check for updates` button.
4. Allow it to find and install any updates that are available.

Many of the updates will require you to reboot your computer. If any of them do require a reboot, allow all of the currently updating components to finish, then reboot the PC. Once rebooted, follow the same steps above to check for more updates and reboot as necessary. Keep following this cycle until Windows Update can no longer find any updates for the PC.

Update Alienware software
-------------------------

If the PC is an Alienware computer and it has been restored using its `Alienware OS Recovery Tool <https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000177401/restore-your-system-using-dell-supportassist-os-recovery>`__, after following :ref:`the steps above <update-windows>`, you will also need to update the Alienware software. You may even have already been shown dialog boxes urging you to do so. I think it would be best to install all of Microsoft's updates to Windows *before* Alienware's, so go do those first.

For future reference, here are links to the `Alienware OS Recovery Tool <https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/osiso/recoverytool>`__ and `instructions on how to use it <https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000123667/how-to-download-and-use-the-dell-os-recovery-image-in-microsoft-windows>`__.
