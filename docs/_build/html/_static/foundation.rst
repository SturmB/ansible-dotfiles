Foundation and Microsoft Store
==============================

Once all of the basic operating system software has been updated, it's time to set some foundation configurations.

File Explorer
-------------

The first configuration change is to set File Explorer's View Mode the way we like it. There's only two settings to worry about and both can be found under :menuselection:`View --> Options --> View tab`. From there, scroll through the list to find and *select* ``Show hidden files, folders, and drives``. Then *de-select* ``Hide extensions for known file types``.

Web Browser
-----------

Since it is likely that we will want to use Google Chrome rather than Microsoft Edge, visit the `Chrome download page <https://www.google.com/chrome/>`__ using Edge, download the browser, and install it.

Once it is installed, sign in with our Google account and all of the bookmarks, extensions, etc. will be immediately be synchronized to the computer. Most of the extensions are self-explanatory. Some of them require signing in (Such as `1Password <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-%E2%80%93-password-mana/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa?hl=en>`__ and `Momentum <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en>`__), but these shouldn't present a problem, especially once :title-reference:`1Password` is installed.

One extension that bears special mention is `Chrome Remote Desktop <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai?hl=en>`__. Once it is installed, you can browse to https://remotedesktop.google.com/ and set up remote access.

One other extension that requires a bit of special setup is `Tampermonkey <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en>`__. If I've been doing things well, I've backed up my scripts to Google Drive, so we'll just need to restore them.

.. TODO: Instructions on how to restore the scripts.
